Forking a Github project is very easy as it is 1-click work, if that project is in public domain. Then cloning the forked project again is very easy with the git clone [$ git clone&nbsp; https://github.com/user/project.git] command. Even, the non git users of a large volume might have used the above command for various reasons.<br /><br />After a [few] commit[s], if we think that the cloned/forked copy of the main project is solving any issues or adding any new compelling feature [after running all the necessary tests] then making a pull request is also 1-click [followed by a few clicks] work.<br /><br />&nbsp;In pull request, our modifications or code additions will be reviewed [best place to learn things] and any more modifications necessary will be pointed out to us. The chances are there even to get our <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/closing-a-pull-request/" target="_blank">pull request closed </a>as someone else might have made a pull request that solved the issue in a better way than yours or due to million other reasons.<br /><br />No matter what, I wanted to have my forked project in sync with the original [upstream] project and so does many developers. Here came the need for me to get to know about 'remote' [1]. So I did.<br /><br />First checking remotes if any exists with the current repo.<br /><br /><span style="color: #3d85c6;">$ <span class="command">git remote -v</span></span><br /><br /><span class="command">If the upstream or the original repo from which the project have been clone wasn't present then add it [2],</span><br /><span class="command">&nbsp;</span><span class="command">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="color: #3d85c6;"><span class="command">$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/<i>ORIGINAL_OWNER</i>/<i>ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY</i>.git</span></span><br /><span class="command"><br /></span><u><span class="command">Method: 1&nbsp;</span></u><br /><br /><span class="command">Then do fetch the latest changes from the upstream</span><span class="command"><span class="command"> [3]</span>,</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #3d85c6;"><span class="command">$ git fetch upstream</span></span><br /><br /><span class="command">merge them with the local repo [it is advised to push/pull the local repo with your own remote repo and have them in sync before syncing with upstream]&nbsp; and resolve any conflicts if exists.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #3d85c6;"><span class="command">$ </span><span class="command">git checkout master</span></span><br /><br /><span style="color: #3d85c6;"><span class="command">$ </span><span class="command">git merge upstream/master</span></span><br /><br /><span class="command"><u>Method: 2 [4] </u></span><br /><br /><span style="color: #3d85c6;"><span class="command">$ git pull upstream master</span></span><br /><span class="command"></span><br /><span class="command"></span><br /><span class="command"></span><br /><span class="command"><br /></span><span class="command"><b>pull</b> does both the <b>fetch</b> and <b>merge</b> at a single step.
