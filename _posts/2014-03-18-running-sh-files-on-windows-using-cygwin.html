Never heard of Cygwin before? No probs, just download the <a href="http://cygwin.com/install.html" target="_blank">Cygwin installer </a>and run it. Once the Cygwin is installed open the Cygwin terminal. Now just using the path of sh.exe located in 'C:\cygwinXX\bin\sh.exe' and the path of your .sh file you could simply run the file using the command:<br /><br /><div><span style="background-color: #9fc5e8;">c:/cygwin64/bin/sh.exe C:/wamp/www/SMIP_Install_v1_1/install.sh</span></div><div><br /></div><div>It will run your .sh file. Note: just check the '/' you use in the path. Don't use '\' but '/' (not windows but UNIX).</div>
