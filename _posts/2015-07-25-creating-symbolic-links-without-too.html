Lets create a shell script named 'what' with a single line, no! two lines with shebang included.<br /><br /><pre  style="font-family:arial;font-size:12px;border:1px dashed #CCCCCC;width:99%;height:auto;overflow:auto;background:#f0f0f0;;background-image:URL(http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_z5ltvMQPaa8/SjJXr_U2YBI/AAAAAAAAAAM/46OqEP32CJ8/s320/codebg.gif);padding:0px;color:#000000;text-align:left;line-height:20px;"><code style="color:#000000;word-wrap:normal;">1:  #!/bin/bash   <br />2:  echo "nothing!"  <br /></code></pre><br />and save the file.<br /><br />Now, make it executable.<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">$ chmod +x what</blockquote><br />then create a symbolic link for it in bin or any other directory that is in your PATH variable.<br /><br />[<br />&nbsp; to check the path just echo it,<br />&nbsp; $ echo $PATH<br />]<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">$ ln -s /home/user/what /bin/what&nbsp;</blockquote><br />here, you could notice that the absolute path of the file to be symlinked is used with 'ln'. It would be sometimes tempting to use relative path or you might feel lazy to type in full path. Nevertheless, always use absolute path while symlinking. If done with relative path, here for example. While doing,<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">$ ln -s what /bin/what </blockquote><br />then, 'what' would be symlinked to /bin/what. i,e I can now run 'what' script from anywhere in my system just like we use 'cd', 'ls' and so. Now when I try to execute 'what', the symlink (/bin/what ) will again point to 'what' (the command) and again it will go run the symlink /bin/what and again from symlink it will point to command 'what' and the cycle continues. This will be indicated as error message in shell as,<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">zsh: too many levels of symbolic links: what</blockquote>
