If you are about to learn Forth, then pay attention when they say "It's a stack based programming language". At first, I thought this as some sort of technical shit boasting out the implementation of Forth or something as I'm a low life programmer. But after fiddling with it for a while (thanks to the "Implicit Data Passing" section of <a href="http://thinking-forth.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Thinking Forth by Leo Brodie</a>) I finally understood what stack based programming is and now I've written my first working program in Forth which I was trying for the past few hours: a function to sum two numbers.<br /><br />: ADD + ;<br />5 10 ADD CR .<br /><br />Now, this stack based programming is exciting (I'm yet to know thier pros and cons). Here, in the above two lines of code, I'm assigning the '+' operator to the word 'ADD'. Then in the next line I'm adding the numbers 5 and 10 then printing them on the screen as the word 'ADD' means '+'. The second line of code is&nbsp; equivalent to <br /><br />5 10 + CR .<br /><br />where 'CR' is carriage return and '.' is used to print the output value to screen. So, don't worry about 'CR' and '.'.<br /><br />What I understood from the above: 5 is first stored (pushed) in to the stack and&nbsp; then 10 is stored (pushed) above 5. With Last In First Out LIFO 'ADD' which&nbsp; translates to '+' adds the last two values (by popping them out) of the stack and&nbsp; puts (pushes) the output on the top of the stack. So, here we would be having 15&nbsp; at the top of the stack which is printed out to us by '.' operator.<br /><br />Now, I wanted to show how this program works to my friends by summing a pair of integers. But, it was painfull (&amp; not so cool) to type 'CR .' at the&nbsp; end of each function call to print the output of the function 'ADD' each time. Then&nbsp; the below lines from <a href="http://thinking-forth.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Thinking Forth</a>, by Leo Brodie, flashed into my brain (which won't happen very often),<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">The smallest atom of a Forth program is not a module or a subroutine or a&nbsp; procedure, but a “word.”</blockquote><br />and<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Everything in Forth is a word.</blockquote><br />So, here '+' should be a word, 'CR' should be a word and '.' should be a word too. And in Forth we can group together any number of words and assign it to a word.<br /><br />: ADD + CR . ;<br />5 10 ADD<br /><br />This is not only cool, but seems powerful to me. Now, I'm getting excited to&nbsp; further dive into Forth. <br /><br />Also, some of my friends argued that the below piece of code won't qualify for a function to which I wrote the below code, a function to sum four numbers.<br /><br />: 4add + + +&nbsp; cr . ;<br />9 8 1 2 4add<br /><br />Which outputs 10<br /><br />
