I just happen to come across this <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1645089/" target="_blank">documentary (Inside Job)</a> on how the financial crisis raised in 2008, sucked millions of jobs out and fucked with people all around the world. This movie rekindled my anger,&nbsp;&nbsp;frustration and hate towards people in power and I'm already feeling sick while I'm only half way across finish watching this doc. I know we can do nothing about it and all we can do is just <i>suck it</i>.&nbsp;Whatever..., I can't stop watching this doc and I'm going to finish this.&nbsp;&nbsp;At least&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have a satisfaction of knowing what happens behind the curtains like finance, economy, stocks, bonds, mutual fund, investment, banker and stuff. Now I know that I'm a fuckin stupid, actually most of us are and we are keeping robbed in a legal way that we pay our own money in the name of tax to protect the robbers from not to stop robbing from us.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><object class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/AsjeObJMDQQ/0.jpg" height="266" width="320"><param name="movie" value="http://youtube.googleapis.com/v/AsjeObJMDQQ&source=uds" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><embed width="320" height="266"  src="http://youtube.googleapis.com/v/AsjeObJMDQQ&source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div><br />
