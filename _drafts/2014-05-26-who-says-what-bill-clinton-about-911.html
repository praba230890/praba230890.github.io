<b>Clinton:</b><br /><blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;">I had battle plan strong, to go into&nbsp;Afghanistan overthrow the Taliban, and launch a full scale attack search for Bin Laden. But we needed basing rights which we got after 9/11. The CIA and FBI refused to certify that Bin Laden was responsible. <b>While I was there, they refused to certify.</b></div></blockquote><b><br /></b><b><br /></b><b><br /></b><b><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3L2513JFJsY" target="_blank">Source</a></b>
