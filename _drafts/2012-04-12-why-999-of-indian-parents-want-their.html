<h3>   </h3><h3>    Why I'm thinking about it and Why today!</h3><br />Today, I accidentally saw my uncle who is actually my mom's elder brother after some 5-7 years and it took me some minutes to make sure he was my uncle. No, actually he changed a bit physically, with some beard grown and got gray hair all over his head and that's what took me some minutes to recognize him. I like him a lot since I met him for the first time as a child, may be while I was 5 or 6. He was kind and loved us and I believe he cares about everyone around him although they weren't close to him.<br /><br />Actually he is a doctor in a small village and own some land where he himself practice agriculture without hiring heavy&nbsp;labors. I know what you think that, why a doctor wants to do such a hard stuff and I wondered that myself but never asked him. May be he was fond of nature or may be he loves agriculture and stuff after all he was born and grown in a village surrounded by farm land or may be he wants to make some extra money. I sure don't know what's the reason, but I'm glad he was&nbsp;practicing&nbsp;agriculture.<br /><br />Actually, I was desperate about the agriculture and farms. I'll buy some land one day and will turn that into a beautiful farm but not by myself and with the help of some people. But, my uncle desperately wants his son to be a doctor too. He was so desperate about it, I saw in his eyes while he was talking about his son and how hard he is looking for a seat on a medical institute for his son. He doesn't even cared or bothered about choosing any other career for his son. He just wants his son to be a doctor (period). After he left, I was&nbsp;thinking&nbsp;like,&nbsp;"WHY! Why doctor? and not any other career?", deeply.<br /><h3>   </h3><h3></h3><h3>    Medical college fees are darn high and includes 5 years of academic learning. "Still, why a doctor!"</h3><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7r1QY2eK4uw/T4XwS9xlWeI/AAAAAAAAAlY/DcbCf2gn4us/s1600/sad-doctor-thumb-400xauto-18773.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7r1QY2eK4uw/T4XwS9xlWeI/AAAAAAAAAlY/DcbCf2gn4us/s320/sad-doctor-thumb-400xauto-18773.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>Already, his son finished high school and my uncle applied for some top medical institutes,&nbsp;visiting&nbsp;some institutes around our state and preparing him for some entrance exams to get a merit seat. I hope he gets into one of the best colleges on merit.<br /><br />Talking about merit seat is easy but getting one on a medical college, in India, the country where I'm living in, was not that easy. Sometimes ordinary people like me can't even consider or think about getting into a medical college without any recommendations from high-profile political figures. Merit seats was all bullshit! I mean if there were 70 seats in a college, then 50 seats would be filled by recommendations added with tens of lacks and for bright students sake there might be 20 seats allotted, but for tens of thousands of students. As, I said "It's bullshit!". Even beyond that there were reservations on those 20 seats based on casts.<br /><br />Also, I was shocked to hear my uncle saying, "my son won't be getting a medical college and become a doctor until I had to spend some Rs. 40 to Rs.50 lacks (4 to 5 million rupees)". That was humungus, I mean huge to spend for a medical college and that is not what I thought could cost for a medical seat either, in India. The donations, which every medical institute in India compulsively gets from the students is what costs half of the fees I mentioned above, letting medical colleges enjoy hundreds of millions of rupees from students without any tax. Isn't that big bullshit! which the government knows every bit about these donations and they doesn't seem like caring about this issue.<br /><br />How could they! as most of the medical, engineering and many other sort of college owners were politicians. &nbsp;It's our foolishness if we expect them to take action against themselves. Leaving this issue behind and I'm getting back to my question again "Why doctor?" in the middle of such a huge fees and while half of that fees were paid illegally as donation. "Why doctor?" and I think I got the answer.<br /><h3>   </h3><h3></h3><h3>    It's because, they care about their&nbsp;children. I mean an extreme care.</h3><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Di06vDhH9Vc/T4XzUgEkPlI/AAAAAAAAAlg/s5GoFoK8LXE/s1600/ayurveda-child-care.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Di06vDhH9Vc/T4XzUgEkPlI/AAAAAAAAAlg/s5GoFoK8LXE/s320/ayurveda-child-care.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>It's all about the care, at the end of my deep thinking. Yeah! they care about their children's life and that's the reason for most of the time and for the&nbsp;99.9% of Indian parents to want their children's to become a doctor. What they exactly want their children's is to become a doctor and live without facing any problem both&nbsp;economically and socially (sometime politically) to the rest of their lives.<br /><br />India is a tough country to make a living, may be next to countries filled with terrorists and China. We live in a society filled with low paying jobs and with a population exceeding the jobs available and at last but not least a worst government filled with greedy politicians (I'm not talking about all the politicians but the greedy ones. You know! whom I'm mentioning?). It's not easy to have a stable happy life here without caring about the price hikes and food deficiency growing each day at a rapid rate.<br /><br />The parents who are all encountered/encountering those hard times already, surely doesn't want their children's to hold on to a low paying job with a creepy life set behind. Also, the parents who were rich enough to avoid such a hard time living in India too wants their children's to be happy at the rest of their life.<br /><br />Those parents who take their son and daughter to a medical college and spending more than Rs. 50 lacks (5 million) as the college fees doesn't care to start their own&nbsp;business&nbsp;and pass that&nbsp;business&nbsp;to their&nbsp;children's. Most of the people pay such a huge amount of college fees by wiping out their life savings, still without putting any idea about starting a&nbsp;business&nbsp;into their mind. Because, the businesses includes its own ups and downs which could lead to hard time for their owners and the parents in India doesn't want that happen to their children's.<br /><br />They simply want their children to have a stable income huge enough to make a life without trouble. That's a good thing to do. But, wait are they forcing their child to become a doctor or just suggesting it them!<br /><h3>   </h3><h3></h3><h3>    They have right to care but not to force</h3><div><br /></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3KBPZexJN-4/T4XwGDg0xCI/AAAAAAAAAlQ/xG5IngOS3Kw/s1600/doctor-mouth.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="260" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3KBPZexJN-4/T4XwGDg0xCI/AAAAAAAAAlQ/xG5IngOS3Kw/s320/doctor-mouth.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>I know how much the Indian students from elementary to high school hates the word "doctor". It's not because one day&nbsp;they&nbsp;encountered a doctor pushing a needle of an injection into their butt, but because of their parents yelling at them daily that "you got to study hard to become a doctor". Bullshit, they don't wan't to study hard to become a doctor. First they need to "like to become a doctor", if they do, they would study desperately to become a doctor without their parents torture and any force.&nbsp;</div><div><br />Another problem with the Indian parents is that they want their children's to always study hard, but never wants them to learn anything. They ultimately forget the goal of schools and education. How could they! when living in a country like India. But, there should be enough awareness raised among the parents about the education and let them know that their children's own their rights to choose their own career.&nbsp;</div><div><br />Also, the schools need to stop acting like a factory turning the students into a mark scoring machines to raise their next year fee. They need to get involve into the social problems and need to educate both the students and their parents about the rights the children's got and how&nbsp;forcing&nbsp;those little cute kids could crush their lives entirely.&nbsp;</div><div><br />Let me tell you this, even if a kid become a doctor one day eventually by the force of their parents. He can have a lot of money but he can't be happy to the rest of his life. The operation theaters and&nbsp;treatment rooms would be filled with sad money making souls and not the doctors desperate to save the people's life.&nbsp;I'm already staring seeing those kind of forced doctors. A friend of mine was forced into a medical college by their parents and let me tell you this, he wasn't happy, he drinks a lot and I believe he was sober for the last couple of years. For the record, my friend was forced to do the high school (+2) twice by his parents to tune his brain and force him to study hard (but they never cared about what he learned and what he loved) and both of his parents are teachers.</div>
