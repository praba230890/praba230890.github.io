But, it wasn't fair. It was just about the beginning of a young soul's dream. Arun was going to a convocation to be held at our college last Saturday, where we did our bachelors of engineering to earn the degree to which he worked very hard for the past four years. But, the dream was crushed even before it started and he was too young to get separated from his family, friends and the rest of the world by a demon.<br /><br /><div>The demon that everybody calls as a road accident is which brought such a deep sorrow and pain over to a lot of Arun's friends and family members. We always feel sorrow just by words when we read or hear the number of people daily dies on roads, but at our hearts no one gives a shit about road accidents. It can't be explained in words, the sorrow and pain that a single road accident brings over to a large number of people. The people dies in those accidents were irreplaceable not only for that persons family and friends but for the whole world.<br /><div><br /></div><div>The guilty stays with us all, the whole of us. Because it wasn't just a soul that was crushed in that road accident, it was a dream of a young boy to become a great dancer was crushed, the dream of a young engineering graduate to get a great job and bring proud to their family got cruised, the dream of a young adult to start a family on his own and raise kids got shattered and so did a lot other dreams of him. </div><div><br />He literally have two families. He loved them both more than they could have loved him, I believe. His family wasn't so rich but enriched with love of four womens. Arun had 3 sisters who were lovely and adorable like their mother. They were kind and great enough to treat all of Arun's friend as their brothers and it was just some months ago, Arun was so happy about his sisters marriages. He was born way too late in his family as the first boy after his three sisters and it was him the reason his parents tried giving birth right from their second daughter again and again to have a baby boy in their home until Arun was born. He was like their dream baby. Now, it was getting harder for me to even think about the pain and sorrow their family must be going through because of his loss. I feel very sorry for his family and they would be in my thoughts. I can't get away from this incident which keeps my mind busy thinking about him, and this is the reason why I'm writing this.</div><div><br />Thinking about other family he had, was his uncle's family to whom he showed almost the same love that he showed to his family. He loved his uncle, aunt and their daughters too. He would keep talking about them even for weeks when we let him to. He had a lot of their family photos and videos in his computer and talked to them in phone as often as he could. He can't give his brain rest from thinking about either one of the above two families he had. Some time I felt the intense of his love for his uncle family seems way too higher than to his mom, dad &amp; sisters.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I asked him, why? you talk to your family that has blood relationship with you less than your uncle's family on both phone and in person. His eyes started pushing out the tears slowly while his mouth started whispering that, "It was my dad, who was strict while I was a kid and was afraid of him. That is the time my uncle, aunt and their daughters showed love to me. But, later years I started loving my dad way too much like I love the rest of my family but I can't find a way to express it to him. I have no idea of how to do that and I'm still afraid of my dad. But, I believe he knows I love him and I hope he loves me too." That moment<br /><br />I realized that Arun was way too emotional than any one thought he could be so far. </div><div>The other thing that assured me about his emotional character was his love, which I believe his first love happened in his school. He never forgot that girl caused him his first love of his life and always gets emotional every time he talks about it. It went on many restless nights, Arun keep on talking about that girl until he dozes off. He also loved a girl on college, did a lot for her but I can't let myself to tell the end of the love tale he had on college. All I knew was that he loved that girl like hell and decided to do anything, I mean to loose anything in his life to have a happy life with that girl. Now, I believe that was a true love, but he always liked it to keep his love life secret to not to embarrass the girl he loved by giving a chance for rumors to create and circulate all over the college. </div><div><br />He was not only emotional, but also very kind, gentle, and I can't forget the hospitality he showed to us when we went to his home for one college holiday. He was more of and we almost treated him like a younger brother to and by our friends. Arun was always active, curious and had a deep passion for dancing. We call him a dance master and little <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prabhu_Deva" target="_blank">Prabhu Dheva</a> too, sometimes. At the end of the day, Arun was one cute little innocent adorable kid who can't be separated from the heart of his friends and his family forever. Just rest in peace for now, my friend, Arun and I'll meet you one day, sooner or later.</div></div>
