<blockquote class="tr_bq">I'm a bit of a programmer, that's why I started my blog with an "Hello World!" post. This is not my first blog, but my first blog where I'm going to write some of my personal thoughts, personal life and whatever I would like to write about. You know why! because, this blog is free to create and to know more about creating free blogs check my post "<a href="https://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;sugexp=frgbld&amp;gs_nf=1&amp;tok=0yQV8bErrC3lkjGBYWpOhA&amp;cp=42&amp;gs_id=4&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=online+test+to+prove+that+I'm+not+an+idiot&amp;pf=p&amp;output=search&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;oq=online+test+to+prove+that+I'm+not+an+idiot&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;gs_l=&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.,cf.osb&amp;fp=7db0b50b83c4e821&amp;biw=1370&amp;bih=643" target="_blank">What is a blog and how to a create free blog and irritate others</a>", on my tech blog so that I could redirect more of you guys to my blog to get more revenue. No! not really, I'm just kidding.</blockquote>Also, before&nbsp;subscribing&nbsp;to my blog (by the way, who does it?) read the below points, so that you won't be misguided.<br /><br /><ul><li>I won't write often on this blog, sometimes.</li><li>I would write more often on this blog, sometimes.</li><li>I might sometime have a chance of forgetting that I created this blog.</li><li>WTF! Asshole! Fuck You! Fuck my boss! are some words I could possibly use sometimes or sometimes I forget those words.</li><li>I love&nbsp;writing a personal blog when I'm drunk, so for children's: Be careful.</li></ul>Fuck you! &amp; yeah, I told you that's coming already. &nbsp;<a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/158/409434721_0a3ee7ea41_o.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/158/409434721_0a3ee7ea41_o.gif" height="50" width="50" /></a><br /><br /><br />Note: I don't do drinks, smoke and drugs, but I always use them for fun. No! I mean not using them in real life, but will be using those words on my blog for fun.<br />.
