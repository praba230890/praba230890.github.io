Tomorrow, me and some of my friends are about to be going on a four day trip to some hills and mountains, and some of them are having waterfalls. Oooooohhhhooooo!!!!!<br /><br />I dragged myself this morning with some of my friends to a youth shop that was residing a mile away from my room. You know youth shops?<br /><br />We call the shops, occupied by a shit load of things that most of the population in the country doesn't even have of clue of them existence, as youth shops. Some of those things are bongs, club rolling papers, pendants (fuck, Bob&nbsp;Marley, ...),&nbsp;dwarven&nbsp;sword (I surely don't know why they have it), crazy fashioned inner and outer wears and so. May be in your country the above items might be popular to a majority of population but I'm sure in India, that it's not.<br /><br />So we went in, brought some crazy ass trousers, t-shirts, lensless eyeglasses (both modern and retro), studs and stuff. There in that shop, a cluster of colorful watches stayed in the top rack behind the cashier bewitched my eyes. There stood Casio's G-Shock watches beautifully strap-positioned, creating a seductive itch around my wrist. I've always wanted one of those G-Shocks strapped around my wrist as weirdly (most people think so and most&nbsp;people&nbsp;don't) Eminem was the reason for it.<br /><br />They were duplicate G-Shocks made by some Chinese factory. It costs only one fourth of it's original G-shock watch of same model's price. Still I couldn't afford it, at least for now. But I had enough money to buy one of the low cost bongs and I particularly selected the green color bong.<br /><br />"Wait!...wait a sec!!!!!", a thought of me ordered myself to look at this beautiful piece of art, "Is that a titty bong!", then questioned myself in awe. Just within a few minutes of bargaining I got hold of those titts and yes they were green. Green gives me peace no matter what. After purchasing a lump load of shit from the shop, we decided to visit a cool drinks shop located 2 blocks away to quench ourselves from our planet's primary source of energy, sunlight.<br /><br />One friend says to visit an ATM first.<br />Near ATM, an armed van was standing as we saw inside the atm was 2 people dead, one of whom was a security guy with a rifle.<br />We checked the driver seat of van, which has lot of blood but had no person.<br />We looked around the street and found no one.<br />Argued heavily about what might have happened and what we are gng to do.<br />One of my friend already covered his face with a napkin or kerchief. Then we talked all rationally about looting the money out of there that were left near the security guy.<br />We covered our faces and planned to enter the ATM, grab the money and run. But, Ram who thought of making fun with the security camera ran toward it faster like a wind to scare them but the wind unwinded the kerchief from his face and let the camera record his face. That was dumb.<br />We then took the money, took the van and ran it on the NH for around five minutes and found a perfect place filled with trees and shrubs and parked the van there. After clearing evidences from the van we
