w<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB_eWW5ttaM" target="_blank">atching Rahul Gandhi's interview on youtube with Arnab Goswami</a> and I can't keep myself straight from a hell lot of laughing. I am just 20 minutes through the video and already seeing Rahul cornered by simple questions and talking all senseless and stuff. God! help India. I don't have much to say right now. Seriously! I can't take no more Indian politics acting all lame and corrupt. But this interview shit is exceptionally funny to pass without watching. I'm gonna continue watching this and I'm gonna talk about how funny it is for may be a week... No! definitely until the election ends. Again, GOD HELP INDIA!!!!!<div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><object width="320" height="266" class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="https://ytimg.googleusercontent.com/vi/xB_eWW5ttaM/0.jpg"><param name="movie" value="https://youtube.googleapis.com/v/xB_eWW5ttaM&source=uds" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><embed width="320" height="266"  src="https://youtube.googleapis.com/v/xB_eWW5ttaM&source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div><div><br /></div>
