To take a particular element out of a list we just use the index of that element like,<br /><br />a_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]<br />print a_list[2]<br />3<br /><br /><br />Then what if someone wants to get a sequence of elements from a list starting from a particular index while ending at an index greater than the starting index. We call that list splicing (I'm not sure if everyone is calling it as list slicing)<br /><br />So, here is an example,<br /><br />a_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]<br />b_list = a_list[2:5]<br />print b_list<br />[4, 5, 6]<br /><br />It's cool right! But, some times we want to take a sequence of elements but with periodic skipping of elements in between. Python has even the power to do that. <br /><br />For example if we want to take out only the even numbers from the a_list, I could do so by<br /><br />b_list = a_list[1::2]<br />print b_list<br />[2, 4, 6, 8, 0]<br /><br />In 'a_list[1::2]', there are two cool things you could notice.<br /><br />First, we haven't mentioned any ending parameter to slice, but it was defaulted to the end of the list. This will work for the starting index too. i,e for taking out only the odd elements out of a_list, we could do so by,<br /><br />b_list = a_list[::2]<br />print b_list<br />[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]<br /><br />Here, 'a_list[::2]' slices the list from start to end with a step size of 2. <br /><br />Second, the step size. Here giving the step size of 2 fetches every second element starting from the first parameter up to but not including the last parameter.<br /><br /><br />b_list = a_list[]<br /><br /><br />The list slicing in python is so simple, just use the square brackets with maximum of 3 parameters separated by colons (not comma). Just like this,<br /><br />a_list = [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]<br />b_list = a_list[2:5]<br /><br />the last line is equivalent to [if you don't know list comprehension see, Appendix 1 and you should learn comprehension anyway],<br /><br />b_list = [a_list[i] for i in range(2,5)]<br />print b_list<br />[4, 5, 6]<br /><br />In a_list[2:5], the first parameter is the index of the old list from which the new list is about to begin. The second parameter is the index of the old list where the element before it would be the end of new list. <br /><br />up_to_ten = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]<br />up_to_five = up_to_ten[0:5:1]<br />[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]<br /><br />starting index of up_to_five = 0<br />ending index of up_to_five = 4<br />length of sliced list = 5 <br />step size at which the list gets sliced = 1<br /><br />In the below code, up_to_ten[0:5:1] slices the list up_to_ten and creates a new list up_to_five,<br /><br />where 0 is the starting index, 5 is the ending index plus one, and the last parameter 1 is the step count. i,e up_to_ten[0:5:1] says that get the elements of list up_to_ten starting from index 0 i,e from up_to_ten[0] and move along with a step count of 1 [current index+step count = 0+1=1] and get the next element up_to_ten[1] and again move along with a step count of 1 [current index+step count = 1+1=2] and get the next element, up_to_ten[2] and so on until the ending index is reached.<br /><br />If a step size of 2 has been given then the output will be,<br />up_to_ten[0:5:2]<br />[1, 3, 5]<br /><br />In the below code, up_to_ten[0:5:2] slices the list up_to_ten and  creates a new list, where 0 is the starting index, 5 is the ending index  plus one, and the last parameter 2 is the step count. i,e  up_to_ten[0:5:2] says that get the elements of list up_to_ten starting  from index 0 i,e up_to_ten[0] and move along with a step count of 2  [current index+step count = 0+2=2] and get the next element  up_to_ten[2] and again move along with a step count of 2 [current  index+step count = 2+2=4] and get the next element, up_to_ten[4] and so  on until the ending index is reached.<br /><br />lets again take the list up_to_ten,<br /><br />index&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp; 1&nbsp; 2&nbsp; 3&nbsp; 4&nbsp; 5&nbsp; 6&nbsp; 7&nbsp; 8&nbsp; 9<br />list &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] <br /><br />If I want to slice from elements 2 to 4 in list&nbsp;up_to_ten to new list up_to_five, then I could do it like this,<br /><br />up_to_five = up_to_ten[1:4]<br /><br />up_to_five<br />[2, 3, 4]<br /><br />Now what if I want to extract every 2nd element from the list and make a list along with a range with starting and ending indexes.<br /><br />new_l = up_to_five[0:5:2]<br />new_l<br />[1, 3, 5]<br /><br />As I previously mentioned, the three parameters are optional, to copy the whole list into a new variable, leave all the three parameters empty like,<br /><br />new_l = up_to_five[::]<br />new_l<br />[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]<br /><br />If I want the new list to begin with the start of the old list, then I could leave the<br /><br /><br /><b>Adding and removing a sequence to a list:</b><br /><br />to add/insert a sequence to a list at a particular index,<br /><br />a = [1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]<br />a[2:2] = [3, 4, 5]<br />print a<br />[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]<br /><br />to remove a sequence from a list, starting from and ending at some particular indexes,<br /><br />a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]<br />a[2:5] = []<br />print a<br />[1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]<br /><br />Appendix 1<br />The list comprehension above to equivalent to this below code.<br /><br />a_list = [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]<br />b_list = a_list[2:5]<br /><br />b_list = []<br /><br />for i in range(2,5) :<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b_list.append(a_list[i])<br /><br />Appendix 2<br /><br />
